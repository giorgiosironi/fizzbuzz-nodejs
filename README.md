# FizzBuzz for Node.js

A simple FizzBuzz implementation as a module for Node.js. The module exports a single function taking as an input a `Number` and returning a `String`.

The package is unit tested with Mocha:

```
npm install
npm test
```

And is statically checked with JSHint:

```
npm install
npm run jshint
```
